# Ceiling-Fan

The Program implements a simple ceiling fan in Java Programming Language.

## Minimum Requirements

```
JDK: Version 12
```

```
JUnit: Version 5
```

## Test Statement

- The unit has 2 pull cords: One increases the speed each time it is pulled. There are 3 speed settings, and an “off” (speed 0) setting. If the cord is pulled on speed 3, the fan returns to the “off” setting. One reverses the direction of the fan at the current speed setting. Once the direction has been reversed, it remains reversed as we cycle through the speed settings, until reversed again.

- Assumption - Wall Switched is Powered. (No Wall Switch)

## Test Cases

- The test cases are implemented using JUnit testing framework.
